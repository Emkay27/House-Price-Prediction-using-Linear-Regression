# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

In this notebook we focus on Linear regression, we know that machine learning or specifically the field of predictive modelling is primarily concerned with minimizing the error of a model or making the most accurate predictions possible at the expense of explainability. 

Linear regression was developed in the field of statistics and is studied as a model for understanding the relationship between input and output numerical variables, but has been borrowed by machine learning. Linear regression is one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, this is because it has been around for so long(more than 200 years), it has been studied from every possible angle and often each angle has a new different name, here we will use scikit-learn to implement a simple linear regression on the House price dataset that we found on Kaggle. With simple linear regression when we have a single input, we can use statistics to estimate the coefficients.

Simple linear regression is a type of Regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. The relationship shown by a Simple Linear Regression model is linear or a sloped straight line, hence it is called Simple Linear Regression.

The key point in Simple Linear Regression is that the dependent variable must be a continuous/real value. However, the independent variable can be measured on continuous or categorical values.
